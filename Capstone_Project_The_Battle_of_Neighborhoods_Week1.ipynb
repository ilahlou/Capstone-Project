    "- Venue data will be extracted from the Foursquare location data https://foursquare.com querying only Ice Cream Shops in the target area.<br>\n",
    "- To identify commercial areas within the Target area, Land Use data of Fairfax county will be extracted from ArcGIS Open Data web site https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/64abd9d8f80146a4924727dc42dfba86_0.geojson.<br>\n",
